Although not everything will leave us. There is One who "remains closer than a brother" - One who having loved His people who are in the world, loves them until the end.

White: tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower to a6, after which black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his bishop to any other square of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and jaque mate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black peon in a7, with the same result.
