Tatoeba is a dictionary of languages. You can search for words and get translations. But it is not exactly a typical dictionary. It is a phrase, not words. You can look for phrases containing a word, and obtain translations of the phrases. Why phrases, you will ask yourself? Because the phrases are more interesting, the phrases obviously give context to the words, the phrases have personalities, they can not be funny, they are really funny, they are very much the same as the English language. It is because of this that Tatoe is multilingual, and that is the kind of language that is not the same as the languages, and what we really want to do is the way in which the languages are translated.

White: a1 tower, a6 in a6. Black: a7 and b7, a8 king, a 8 a.m., acre. White put the opponent in zugzwang playing the a a6 tower, after which blacks have only two options: take the tower in a6 or move their alfil to any other square of the b8-h2 diagonal. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and check mate. In the second situation, the white turret takes the black pawn at a7, with the same result.
White Supremacy: When you have nothing else to be proud of.
White had the advantage of change (tower against alfil) plus a pawn past in a3.
Whites won the game by blocking their opponent’s dame and pawns so they couldn’t move or jump anywhere.
