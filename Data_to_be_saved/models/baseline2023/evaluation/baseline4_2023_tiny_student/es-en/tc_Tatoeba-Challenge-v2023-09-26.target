Whites: a1 pinion in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns at a7 and b7, king at a8, alfil in b8. The whites put the opponent on zugzwang playing the tower a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alfil to any other box of the b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and check mat. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black peon in a7, with the same result.
White Supremacy: By when you have nothing else to be proud of.
White had the advantage of change (tower against alfil) plus a pawn past in 3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The whites won the game by blocking the lady and pawns of their opponent, so they could not move or jump anywhere.
