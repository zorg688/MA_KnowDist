I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipinos. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, read in English, although they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is very aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are however some comics and other literature in tagalo for the masses. Many Filipinos do not really want to read in English, since perhaps they do not attract, so rarely read, but they see tagological tags. The pastelian is not very widely used, as the French incantation is not written in the ancient script Bayburinbay, but the standard one preserves the tagalopae.

White: rook in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawons in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. White put opponent in zugzwang playing tower a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the tower in a6 or move your bishop to any other square of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, white advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and checkmate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
