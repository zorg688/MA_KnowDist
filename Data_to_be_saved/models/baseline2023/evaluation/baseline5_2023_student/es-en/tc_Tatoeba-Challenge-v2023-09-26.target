I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipino. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, they read in English, although they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is very aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, however, some comics and other literature in Tagalog for the masses. Many Filipinos really do not want to read in English, since perhaps they do not attract them in ancient French-Tacala, so they rarely read, but they watch television, videos or movies, more commonly in the indigenous language. So do you suspect that the Roman letters do not attract some Filipinos. The tagloid is not written in the old Baybayin, but the standard keeps the amorphous color the sybollians. The literature has yet to be very broad, as the indo literature in the neighboring literature is.
