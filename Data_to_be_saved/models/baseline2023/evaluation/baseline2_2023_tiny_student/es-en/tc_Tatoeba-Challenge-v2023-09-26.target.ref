Black moved his white-squared bishop to g4, nailing the white knight on f3, which served as a shield for the queen on d1.
Black places the first stone at D5, and White responds by placing his first stone at F5. The dispute for territory starts near the board center.
Black plays E8 and captures the white stone on D8. On E8, the black stone is at Ko, that is, on the next move, White will be prohibited from capturing it by playing D8. White then plays E2, practically forcing Black to play E1. Now White can play D8 and capture the Ko stone.
Black responded to White's attack on the kingside by counterattacking in the center.
Black's move occupied the last liberty that was left to five white stones, in two strings. Those five stones were thus captured and removed.

I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipinos. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, they read in English, although they commonly speak an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is highly aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, nevertheless, some comics and other literature in Tagalog for the masses. Many Filipinos do not really want to read in English, as maybe it does not attract them, so they seldom read, but instead watch television, videos, or cinema, most commonly in the indigenous language. I suspect that Roman letters do not attract some Filipinos. Tagalog is no longer written in the ancient Baybayin script, but the Unicode Standard conserves the syllabograms. Tagalog literature is not yet extensive, as is that of neighbouring Indonesia. English is like a fizzy pink soda, whilst Tagalog is like a yellow-brown cassava cake. (Some French have stated that Tagalog is more like a grey shark in the sea. But I could imagine some Italians equating Tagalog with squid ink spaghetti. Maybe Tagalog is like Spanish "jamón de pata negra," an expensive delicacy.)

Meanwhile, with English, though I don't speak it perfectly either, I do introduce that variety, and I have the experience of speaking it with same-age peers, learning different ways to express myself.

Tatoeba is a book that has been written in hundreds of languages and is now over a million pages long.
Tatoeba is a community.
Tatoeba is a great way to procrastinate.
Tatoeba is a language dictionary. You can search for words, and get translations. But it's not exactly a typical dictionary. It's all about sentences, not words. You can search for sentences containing a certain word, and get translations for the sentences. Why sentences, you may ask? Because sentences are more interesting, sentences bring context to words, sentences have personalities, they can be funny, smart, silly, insightful, touching, hurtful, and sentences can teach us a lot more than just words. So, we love sentences, but even more, we love languages. And what we really want is to have many sentences in many, and any languages. This is why Tatoeba is multilingual, but not the kind where languages are simply being patterned together, and where some pairs are left behind. Tatoeba is really multilingual, all the languages are interconnected. If an Icelandic sentence has a translation in English, and the English sentence has a translation in Swahili, then indirectly, this will provide a Swahili translation for the Icelandic sentence. Languages that would have never found themselves together in the traditional system can be connected in Tatoeba. Awesome, right? But, where do we get those sentences, and how do we translate them? Obviously, this cannot be the work of one person. This is why Tatoeba is collaborative.

When we come to die, we shall be alone. From all our worldly possessions we shall be about to part. Worldly friends — the friends drawn to us by our position, our wealth, or our social qualities, — will leave us as we enter the dark valley. From those bound to us by stronger ties — our kindred, our loved ones, children, brothers, sisters, and from those not less dear to us who have been made our friends because they and we are the friends of the same Saviour, — from them also we must part. Yet not all will leave us. There is One who "sticketh closer than a brother" — One who having loved His own which are in the world loves them to the end.

White: rook on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the rook to a6, after which Black has only two options: take the rook on a6 or move his bishop to any other square on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and checkmates. In the second situation, the white rook takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
White supremacism: for when you have nothing else to be proud of.
