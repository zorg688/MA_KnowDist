When the king of your opponent, who is in the first (or eighth) row, is blocked by his own pawns or pieces, if you can, with the lady or a tower, give him check, even if this initially requires one or two sacrifices, the result of this maneuver will be the murder.

White: tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, ab8. Whites put the opponent on zugzwang playing the tower a6 after which black ones have only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his or her to any other square of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and matejaque. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn in a7 with the same result.
White Supremacy: By when you have nothing else to be proud of.
Whites had the advantage of change (turning against alphite) plus a pawn past a3.
