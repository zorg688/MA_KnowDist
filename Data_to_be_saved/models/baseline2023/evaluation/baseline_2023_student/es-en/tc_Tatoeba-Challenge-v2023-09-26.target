I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipinos. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, read in English, although they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is very aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, however, some comics and other literature in tagalo for the masses. Many Filipinos don't really want to read in English, since they may not attract them, so rarely do they read, but they watch television, videos or cinema, more commonly in the indigenous language. Supposedly, the Roman letters do not attract some taghide to some of the philippines. The tagalo is not written in the ancient script Baybayin, but the standard is kept by the Unicode script, but if you watch television, videos or cinema, more commonly in the indigenous language.
