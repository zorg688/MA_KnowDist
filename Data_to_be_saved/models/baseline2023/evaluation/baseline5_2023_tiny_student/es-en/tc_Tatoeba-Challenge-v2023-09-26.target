White: a1 tower in b6, king in b8. Negras: pawn in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfil in b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower a6 a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the tower in a6 or move to the other square of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites are advancing their pawn from b6 to b7 and jaque mat. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
White Supremacy: By when you have nothing else to be proud of.
The whites had the advantage of change (turning against the fil) plus a pawn past in a3. The victory was a matter of technical.
The whites won the game by blocking the lady and the pawns of their opponent, so they could not move or jump anywhere.
