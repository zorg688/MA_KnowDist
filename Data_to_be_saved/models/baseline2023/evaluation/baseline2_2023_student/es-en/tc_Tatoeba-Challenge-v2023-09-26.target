I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipino. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, they read in English, even though they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. Philippines is very aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, however, some comics and other literature in Tagalog for the masses. Many Filipinos really do not want to read in English, as perhaps they are not drawn in the French language, so they rarely read it, but they see television, videos or cinema, more commonly in the native language. I suspect that Roman lyrics are not quite so wide-ranging, like the Indian literature. The Tagalog is no longer written in the ancient script Baybayin, but the taga tag is apt to have a tag. The tagalo is not yet as broad as the infidel literature.

I speak Spanish so often, I can speak (or, rather, write) in a more or less correct way, but I don’t have much color or variety in my language. I always use the same structures, which I know, so I’m not inventing ways to express something and sound like I’m speaking English. I say the same thing over and over again, without many idiomatic expressions, and when I try to use those I know, I’m watering it up. Meanwhile, with English, I also don’t do it perfectly, I have that variety, and that experience of talking it so much with my age partners, ways to know how to express themselves.

While we're waiting, why don't you tell me what happened?
White: a1 tower, a6 a6 pawn, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, a8 alfil in b8. Whites put opponent in zugzwang playing the a6 tower, after which blacks have only two options: take the a6 tower or move their bishop to any other square of the b8-h2 diagonal. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and checkmate mate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
White Supremacy: When you have nothing else to be proud of.
White had the advantage of switching (tower against bishop) plus a pawn passed in a3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The Whites won the game by blocking the lady and the pawns of their opponent, so that they could not move or jump anywhere.
