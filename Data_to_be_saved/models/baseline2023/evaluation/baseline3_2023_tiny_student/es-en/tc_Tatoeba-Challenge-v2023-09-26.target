I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipinos. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, read in English, even though they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is very aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, however, some comics and other literature in tagaloa for the masses. Many Filipinos don’t really want to read in English, as perhaps they do not attract them, because they rarely do, but see television, videos or cinema, more commonly in the indigenous language. So, I suspect that Roman lyrics do not attract some filililines. Tagalogue is no longer written in the old book, but the standard of Unicode preserves the siograms.

Tatoeba is a dictionary of language. You can search for words and get translations. But it is not exactly a typical dictionary. It is phrases, not words. You can search phrases containing a word, and obtain phrases of sentences that contain a word, and obtain phrases of phrases that make a word. Why are you asking? Because the phrases are more interesting, the phrases give the context to the words, the phrases have personalities, these can be graceful, intelligent, tomental, telltale, conmoverous, convolent, and the phrases can teach us much more than the words. So, we are simply speaking out, and beyond that, we love the languages. And what are we who are not, in the way are, they are the ones that are the one. So, you have a way that is to be translated by the Greeks, but it is the one that is the one.
