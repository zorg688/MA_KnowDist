White: tower in a1, peon in b6, king in c8. Black: peons in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfil in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower a6 a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower in a6 or move their alfil in b8. In the second case, the white b8-h.

The whites had the advantage of change (torre against alfil) plus a peon passed in a3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The whites won the game by blocking the lady and the peons of her opponent, so they could not move or jump anywhere.
