White: tower in a1, peon in b6, king in c8. Black: peons in a7 and b7, king in a8, alphine in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower to a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alphine to any other box of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the white b6 leads to the first.
