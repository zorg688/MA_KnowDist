White: tower in a1, peon in b6, king in c8. Black: peons in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfil in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower to a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower in a6 or move their alfil to any other box of the diagonal b8-h2. In the case of the first, the b8-h2 takes the first.
White supremacy: for when you have nothing else to be proud of.
The whites had the advantage of change (tower against alfil) plus a past peon in a3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The whites won the game by blocking the lady and the peons of their opponent, so they couldn’t move or jump anywhere.
