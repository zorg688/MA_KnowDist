Whites: tower in a1, peon in b6, king in c8. Black: peons in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfil in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower at a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower in a6 or move their alfil to any other box of the b8-h2. In the first case, the white tower.
White supremacy: for when you have nothing else to be proud of.
The whites had the advantage of change (tort against alfil) plus a peon past in a3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The whites won the game blocking the lady and the peons of their opponent, so they couldn’t move or jump anywhere.
