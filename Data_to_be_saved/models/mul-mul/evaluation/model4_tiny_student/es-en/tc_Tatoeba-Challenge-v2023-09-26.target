Whites: tower in a1, peon in b6, king in c8. Blacks: peons in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfil in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower at a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower in a6 or move the second side of the white to the other box of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the black tower, and the first white bean, and the first white bees, and the first white bean, and the first white bean, and the first white bean, and the first white bean, and the first white bean, and the first, the white bean, and the first, the white-net, the white-bathy, and the same white-btrews. In the first place, the white-day, and the first-white bean, and the first white bean, and the first white-brow, and the first-white, the white-seat of the first.

The whites had the advantage of exchange (tower against alfil) plus one peon past in a3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The whites won the game by blocking the lady and the peons of their opponent, so they couldn’t move or jump anywhere.
