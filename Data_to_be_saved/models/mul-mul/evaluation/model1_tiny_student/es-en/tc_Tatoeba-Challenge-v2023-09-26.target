Whites: tower in a1, peon in b6, king in c8. Black: peons in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfil in b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower to a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower in a6 or move their alfil to any other box of the diagonal b8-h2.
White supremacy: for when you have nothing else to be proud of.
The whites had the advantage of change (torre against alfil) plus a peon past a3. The victory was a matter of technique.
The whites won the game by blocking the lady and the peons of their opponent, so they could not move or jump anywhere.
